            <p> This service allows claimants or their representatives to notify Acas of a workplace dispute and choose whether they want early conciliation or to get a certificate to the employment tribunal for a judge to decide. It is a statutory service, and claimants cannot access the employment tribunal without first making a notification to Acas. Acas receives around 120,000 notifications a year.   </p>

<p> Early conciliation is a largely telephone-based service that involves speaking with individuals and organisations in the dispute. Highly-trained conciliators help parties understand relevant legal principles and assist them to reach a resolution.
  </p>

  <p>If a resolution cannot be found, or the claimant does not want conciliation, then Acas provides a certificate that allows parties to take their dispute to the employment tribunal.  </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Problem to be solved 1:</h3>

        <p>When we spoke to early conciliation support officers and conciliators, they told us that every day, they get duplicate submissions from the same users and most of the time it is incomplete. That is, the same users were submitting the form multiple times. In fact, one of the early conciliation support offers said that on the day when we spoke to her, one user had submitted the same form 4 times. When asked how often this occurs? She said “90% of the time. ”. When we were observing the early conciliation support officer take calls from the users, we saw first-hand how frustrated the users were when they would call in to say that they had submitted form two times, but the early conciliation support officer still did not have all the information. Then the officer had to collect the information all over again, over the phone. After the early conciliation support officer took the data from the user, she had to search for multiple incomplete entries, which the user had made, then close these cases and pick the reason as “duplicate” for closing the cases. They said the reason this was happening is that users were not sure if they had submitted the form when they were moving to form two as this confused the user.
</p>
<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How we solved the problem 1:</h3>

<p>As you can see in the prototype, from the user's point of view there is only one form and now users can save and return to form if they want to. This was one of the recommendations in the previous assessment reports. Now, depending on what answers they give to the questions, they are taken to the relevant section of the form and only asked questions that are relevant to them. For example, if a user selects, “Yes, I would like to try early conciliation” then we ask them about the “reason for dispute”. If the user selects “No, I want the certificate to go to the employment tribunal” then users are only asked to enter the full name and address and employer’s legal name and address.  Having one form and using progressive disclosure to show relevant questions will save valuable time for both the user and the early conciliation support officer.


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Problem to be solved 2:</h3>

<p>One of the biggest problems was that sometimes there was a mismatch between the name and address entered on the ACAS certificate and the Employment Tribunal form.  The case would get thrown out as a consequence. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How we solved the problem 2:</h3>
<p>We have regular coordination meetings with the team at the employment tribunal service to share our learnings from research and see what we can do to improve users' experience of using both services.
</p>

<p>As a result of the continuous and ongoing coordination between teams, the new version of the service will allow users to enter the ACAS certificate number and the legal names and addresses of the claimant and respondents will be loaded from the ACAS database. This will reduce the need for users to re-enter data and potentially avoid errors. Users will save valuable time as a result of effective collaboration between two service teams across organisational boundaries. The coordination efforts have also helped improve the guidance text in the forms-based user research learning between the two teams.

</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Problem to be solved 3:</h3>

<p>Another problem was that the users said that they would stop midway while filling the form and be put off by how long the form was. One user said that she was put off for a week.
</p>



<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How we solved the problem 3:</h3>

<p>Now instead of asking yes or no to all the reasons for the dispute, we ask the user to select the reason for the dispute and only ask questions relevant to the reason. For example, if the reason for the dispute is “Wages or holiday pay” The user is asked only 3 questions instead of 11 pages of questions, as is on the current form. This will also help allocate the case to the appropriate conciliators who specialist experience in handling certain types of cases.

<p>We obtained the script that early conciliation support officers (ECSOs) use when speaking to a claimant for the first time over the phone. This is a series of questions based on the jurisdiction of a case. Working with these frontline workers we tailored the questions in the form to create a question protocol based on data that frontline workers need. Providing this information to these workers earlier will speed up their processes. </p>
<p>There are BAU processes currently in play to instruct frontline workers of any changes early such as Show and Tells, and Champions (super users) that cascade changes to teams/offices. </p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How have these mutually benefited each other?</h3>

<p>By improving the quality of the data collected in the form, frontline workers will better able to allocate cases to the appropriate team and help users solve their problems in a more timely way. Furthermore, better quality data will open up the possibility of automatic allocation (WS3).</p>


<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Increasing digital adoption</h3>

<p>For the period of Jan 2021 - Jan 2022, our insights team reported the proportions of notifications that are made through the different channels in the current service as: </p>



<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
    <li>
98% online </li>
  <li>
  1.5% telephone (ECSO and IC)</li>
  <li>
.3% postal paper form</li>

</ul>

<p>We already have high digital take-up rates (98%), so the challenge is actually to maintain these whilst improving the users understanding of the purpose of the service, and the features of the process without enticing them away from high digital presentation rates. </p>

<p> To maintain/increase digital adoption we work regularly with the content designer on the Acas corporate website to ensure we are signposting users appropriately to the online notification form. </p>

<p>We also have a dedicated helpline, and have designed signposting to offline methods. For example, the content below is on the start page and the footer </p>

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m"> Other ways to notify Acas</h2>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How have we simplified the existing journey?</h3>

<p> Users complained that the existing journey was long winded and asked questions not relevant to them. Using the progressive disclosure, triaging occurs, whereby questions such as whether they are representing themselves, their preferred method of contact, will influence the questions asked. For example, if a user states they just want a certificate then their form will be significantly shorter compared to a user asking for early conciliation. Using progressive disclosure to show relevant questions will save valuable time for both the user and the early conciliation support officer.
</p>
<p>Users said that they would stop midway while filling the form and be put off by how long the form was. </p>

<p>Now instead of asking yes or no to all the reasons for the dispute, we ask the user to select the reason for the dispute and only ask questions relevant to the reason. For example, if the reason for the dispute is “Wages or holiday pay” The user is asked only 3 questions instead of 11 pages of questions, as is on the current form. This will also help allocate the case to the appropriate conciliators who specialist experience in handling certain types of cases.</p>
<p>With branching based on the answers to the questions, they don’t have to see questions that are irrelevant to them.</p>


<p>Compared to the current form, feedback we received in testing include:</p>
<p>“That is a hell of a lot faster than the original form, and probably a lot easier than the update. Obviously, it’s just a lot quicker.”</p>

<p>“Because previously in the other form, there is very limited or no space to put an accurate reflection of what the claim is about.”</p>

<p> We have tested our prototypes with claimants and representatives (professional and non-profession) whom have previously completed the existing form. Users were asked how their experience with the prototype compared with the live form. Feedback showed that the process was simpler for users</p>

<p>We’ve also tested with users who had never completed the existing form previously. We got super positive feedack form them too.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How have we tested this?</h3>

<p>Our user testing was done with users over MS Teams meetings. Users were given links to the prototypes and share screens. The sessions were recorded with user's permission. Lead user researcher would ask questions before and after the test. Observers, would make notes during the testings.

<p>We have also tested the prototype with DAC. </p>

<a class="govuk-link" href="public/images/ACAS_Prototype_DAC_Design_Review_01-02-2022.pdf" target="_blank">New DAC accessibility report on Alpha the prototype - February 2022</a>
<br> <br>
<p>We have done internal testing with tools like Google lighthouse, to ensure we are meeting WCAG – AA at a minimum. </p>

<p>  To ensure the usability across users with different access needs we conducted research with people with access needs.</p>
<p>
We have made an extra effort to test with users that have  disabilities and accessibility needs. <br>
Below are users who have self-identified disabilities that we have tested with so far.
<br>
- 1 professional representative with Dyslexia<br>
- 1 claimant with Manual dexterity issues<br>
- 1 claimant with DCD Dyspraxia<br>
- 1 claimant with Autism<br>
- 1 claimant with Dyslexia and short term memory <br>
- 1 claimant with Asperger's <br>
- 1 claimant with Phobia of being in photos<br>
- 1 claimant with Dyscalculia, dyspraxia<br>

<br>
We also spoke to an advice Worker with Disability in Action, Islington, who works occasionally with people raising disputes with Acas.

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Testing across multiple devices</h3>

<p>Currently, there is roughly a 50% split between mobile and desktop for user accessing our service.</p>

                      <p><Acas already has a well defined and used assisted digital support channel.</p>

                        <p>  There is a specific early conciliation helpline, open working days between 8am and 6pm and charged at 0300 number which is free with inclusive minutes or charged at low cost (3-12p/minute). </p>


<p>

<p>  Users can make a notification via this helpline, with operators completing the digital form on behalf of the user.</p>
<p>The service can be accessed without a phone number or email address by using the paper form. </p>
<p>In the beta phase we will do more work to ensure that the existing assisted digital route can adapt appropriately to the new service.</p>

<p>Currently 800+ paper forms submitted each year.</p>

<p>We are also talking to Policy and legal leads at BEIS, our parent department, the Ministry of Justice and delivery teams at HM Courts and Tribunal Service.</p>
<p>Our service owner and policy lead are also reporting to Acas Council and engaging with Trades’ Union officials, employment lawyers and members of the judiciary.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How have we engaged with teams working on offline channels and/or other workstreams?</h3>

<p> Through the Panel of Experts, organisation-wide show and tells, sprint review and workstream collaboration meetings. </p>

<p>All workstream teams and the BAU team are invited to each others’ sprint reviews and planning. </p>
<p>There are fortnightly programme meetings covering risks, assumptions, issues and dependencies between the workstreams.</p>

<p>The programme leadership team includes a service design lead, user research lead, tech lead, delivery lead, product lead and content lead who manage and run community meetings for workstream team members in their profession. They are also responsible for ensuring that work is shared between teams and that working practices are aligned.
</p>

<p>There are regular all organisation show and tells, where operations staff can find out progress and ask questions These have regularly been attended by 200+ people from across Acas.</p>

<p>Our service owner writes a monthly programme update that is shared with all internal teams with an interest in the programme.</p>

<p>We commenced with a 2 week detailed Discovery phase, which took the learnings from the more wide scale Discovery conducted by Deloitte, and focussed on specifically on the ‘Assisted Notifications’ workstream. The output from this mini-Discovery was: </p>

         <ul class="govuk-list  govuk-list--bullet"">
           <li>
             A clear set of user needs and user stories

           <li>
             A set of hypotheses to test in alpha
           </li>


         </ul>

<p> The Alpha phase was divided up into 4 x 2 weeks sprints. Prior to year end, our sprints were slightly misaligned with the other workstreams due to differing launch points, but we took advantage of the year-end break to realign the sprint ceremonies for Sprints 3 and 4.</p>

<p> At the start of each sprint, we conducted a planning session with the team and agreed the goal, and scope of the sprint based on estimates formed at planning.</p>
<p>
We conducted daily standups for 15mins, where all team members contributed to</p>

<ul class="govuk-list  govuk-list--bullet"">
  <li>
  What they did yesterday
  </li>

  <li>
  What they are doing today
  </li>
  <li>
Any blockers/impediments
  </li>

</ul>
<p>At the conclusion of each sprint, we have a Sprint Review in the form of a show and tell, where invitations were extended right across the ACAS organisation and other workstreams. These sessions were well attended and well-received with audiences of 20+ people.</p>

<p>Following the Sprint Review, we would conduct a Sprint Retro with the immediate team, in order to review our performance and investigate ways of improving processes and delivery.</p>

<p>We used ‘Mentimeter’ to gauge temperatures and discuss outliers, and ‘RetroTool’ to interrogate ‘What went well’, ‘What could improve’, ‘What we should aim to improve form the next sprint’.</p>

<p>Suggested improvements to team ways of working were then monitored at following retros and scored by the team to ensure progress. </p>

 </p>

 <p> There is an existing internal BAU team with product and delivery management, design, devops, user research, business analysis, Dynamics dev and case management support team. This team maintains a backlog of service improvements, regularly releasing against their roadmap.</p>

 <p>During private beta, we will look at the make up of this team and identify any additional roles to ensure that the BAU team can take on management of the service.
 </p>

 <p> We have secured an additional £5m operational funding for the next 3 years through the spending review, ensuring that the team can be assured of adequate resource to continue improving the service through public beta and live.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Risk management</h3>

           <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Security management</h3>

           <p>A robust security patching process has been agreed to ensure application and OS vulnerabilities are constantly monitored and addressed to create a configured environment that is secure against known vulnerabilities.

</p>


 <p>The patching regime covers both core and contributed module security patches that specifically address security vulnerabilities.
   </p>

 <p>It’s important to distinguish functional/feature patches from security patches. We don’t apply ‘functional’ patches as part of our security patching process unless a functional patch also includes a security upgrade, in which case we may need to implement previous feature upgrades at the same time. This will necessitate a larger degree of testing so may require more time from your support allocation than usual.
   </p>

   A <a <href="https://acasorguk.sharepoint.com/:b:/s/IDR70/EWXIkJ0kfktAma3-LD6KkrYBrVSgUJc5DaVGxP6XvBq7Mg?e=2Nb7xC" target="_blank"> security patching policy</a> has been agreed and documented.  </p>


 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Balancing right to privacy with collection of personal information</h3>


<p>A key objective of the service is to limit the amount of personal details collected to the minimum necessary to enable the Service teams to provide the level of support required.</p>

<p>The following sensitive data is collected by the service:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list  govuk-list--bullet"">
  <li>
First and last name of Claimant
  </li>

  <li>
    Claimant’s contact details (email, phone and/or post)

  </li>
  <li>
Representative’s details (legal, union or family representative)
  </li>
     <li>
  Respondent’s details (the organisation against which a claim is being brought)  </li>
  <li>
Other details that are entered into free-text fields  </li>

</ul>

<p>Protection of the users’ data is of paramount importance to the success of the service, as many of the users are in a heightened emotional state when accessing the service and have genuine concerns about the impact that the unauthorised disclosure of their data would have on their situation. </p>
<p> We have worked with the Acas DPO Mark Faulkner to discuss that data that we are intending to collect and its relationship to GDPR, and the means by which we will keep it secure.
  </p>


   <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">     Security testing</h3>

   <p> As part of the beta build activities, we will engage a third party security penetration testing specialist to evaluate the service prior to private beta, and identify any potential security vulnerabilities in line with NCSC guidelines.</p>


 <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">   Cookie policy implementation</h3>

 <p>We are advocating a “cross domain” model of consent using OneTrust to allow for robust cookie consent management across the different sites that make up the ACAS content and notifications estate. This means that any website that shares the same parent domain (in this case *.acas.org.uk) can share the same consent. Consent given on one site automatically transfers to consent given on another. </p>


<p>Our proposed approach for Cookie consent management has been documented <a href="https://acasorguk.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/IDR70/EUZ8iFpetR1Nnz6KTEAY8w0BxCp9w3x20FxH_ISfCKuFNw?e=EXgSPK" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>

            Digital take up

              <li>
              Completion rate
              </li>
           <li>
              Cost per transaction
           </li>
           <li>
            Time to allocation
           </li>
           <li>
    Reallocation rates
           </li>
           <li>
Resolution rates
           </li>


            </ul>

            <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How were the KPIs derived?</h3>

            <p>We’ve taken the four standard KPIs and included three others. We’ve derived these KPIs by looking at the expected outcomes and benefits for the programme.
</p>We want to increase early conciliation take up rates to give claimants the best chance to resolve their case before tribunal. Measuring take up rates will allow us to identify if the service is able to persuade more users to opt in to early conciliation.

<p> Time to allocation is important, as an independent evaluation of the service identified that the faster claimants are able to speak to a conciliator, the more likely a settlement becomes.
</p>
<p>Additionally, if we help users accurately select their ‘reason for dispute’ we will also reduce the number of cases being recategorised after an initial conversation with the claimant.  </p>

<p>If we can collect more complete information about a claimant’s case including dispute type, we will be able to reduce the time to allocation, as we will be able to skip the information gathering stage, which is led by early conciliation support officers (ECSO). This can take time away from focusing on conciliation in the 6 weeks after notification.</p>


  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What does success look like?</h3>

<p>  Reduced time to allocation, reduced numbers of cases reallocated, increased take up of early conciliation.</p>

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">How will we monitor this?</h3>

  <p>We will baseline these rates on the existing service in private beta. This data will be used by the permanent business-as-usual team to identify improvements to be addressed through continuous improvement.</p>
  <p>We have an internal insights team (OPPI - operational performance, planning and insight) as well as a digital performance analyst.</p>



  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">What data are we collecting to help improve the service?</h3>

  <ul class="govuk-list  govuk-list--bullet"">
    <li>
  Google Analytics will collect usage data

    </li>

    <li>
We also have the option of using Google Optimize to A-B test content in the pre-notification stage of the journey.
    </li>

    <li>
  Dynamics will track all case data and outcomes
    </li>
 <li>
  Power BI will be used to transform and display the data.
 </li>



  </ul>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Publishing performance data</h3>

             <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"> Choice of tools and technology</h3>

             <p>The existing primary service already uses Drupal as it’s web and form capture mechanism. Currently this information is put through a closed source black box integration layer ending up in Microsoft Dynamics which is ACAS’s backoffice case management tool.
</p>
<p> After reviewing the existing setup it was determined that Drupal 9 was the best technology choice because of the both existing skill sets within ACAS and because it’s an open source solution and designed on best practice open standards. </p>

<p>From an integration perspective it was determined that the best solution would be to integrate Drupal directly with Microsoft Dynamics as to remove the closed component from the existing structure.`</p>

             <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"> Other options considered
</h3>

             <p>Wagtail is an open source CMS built in Python it is used in the NHS and the arts. It has a strong emphasis on security and integration. Based on ACAS’s existing sites it was determined a move to Python would create additional overheads from staffing to infrastructure complexity. Also the specific developer community while growing is still small with support focused around a single agency.</p>

<p> Word Press is a CMS written in PHP, it’s one of most widely used CMS in the PHP space. It would fit in with the existing team’s PHP skill set and would have made extending the existing infrastructure straightforward. It was deemed less suitable due to its focus on brochure sites and less of an ability to integrate well. Due to its configuration structure the ability to push configuration up and down stream in the different environments (DEV/TEST/LIVE) is more challenging.
</p>

             <h3 class="govuk-heading-m"> Data security</h3>

             <p>As part of the Alpha process, we explored the security provisions around the current service, and looked to where risks existed and improvements could be made.</p>


<p>Key areas that we will develop further in Beta are: </p>

             <ul class="govuk-list  govuk-list--bullet"">
               <li>

When a claimant recalls a draft to complete the submission, the data is pulled back from Dynamics

  <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">  Design patterns</h3>

  <p> We are using design patterns from the Design system. We have alos signed up to and Government Accessibility and Design Communities. We keep sharing our research findings on patterns, like the Task list pattren and have been engaging the community when we need help and need peer reviews.   </p>

<p>  We shared our research on GDS design system <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-design-system-backlog/issues/72" target="_blank"> 'Task list pages' discussion on GitHub </a>. Based on recommendations made by the community, we are experimenting with adding something like "You have completed X of Y required sections [and U of V optional sections]"</p>

<p>
We will use open standards, and propose a new open standard if there is not one that already meets their needs.
  </p>

  <p>
    We intend to use standard government technology components where possible.

<img src="public/images/ccid.png" width="90%;" class="app-mobile-hide" />

                      <p> Continuous integration and continuous delivery is our preferred method of development. It allows us to work through logic/functional bugs as well as coding issues. Currently the service uses Jenkins to deliver this functionality. We would propose to extend on this to allow feature environments to be spun up, verified and destroyed throughout the sprint. Based on this model as well as running unit, functional, integration, accessibility and performance tests we will have shippable code with a high level of confidence.
                        </p>

                <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">  Quality control</h3>
                    <p>During the development phase and in an ongoing BAU test will be written from a unit, functional and integration perspective. As features are built out this body of testing will be run to reduced regressions within the system. Accessibility tools will be run throughout development and in BAU to ensure the service continues to support all users.
</p>
<p> Coding reviews will be carried out during the development and BAU phases from a performance, accessibility, open standards and security perspective to ensure ongoing quality of service.
